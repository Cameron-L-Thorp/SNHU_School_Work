# CS-210 Programming Languages

Included are the temperature converter, Project 2 (Banking Application), and Project 3 (Grocery Store Inventory).  

## Module 8 Assignment -> Project 3:

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  
This project was meant to allow a store to track the freqency of individual items purchased based on a list generated from their checkout machines. The problem was that the checkout machines/inventory system was not producing an easily readable frequency of purchase for items, making it difficult to determine how popular items were. This program solved it by interfacing with the other machine's output and generating easily readable information for the frequency.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job of separating functions, and refactoring code to both speed up the coding process, and also make fixing errors easier. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
An enhancement I could make specific to C++, would be to create header files, although for a project of this size and complexity I didn't think it was necessary. For larger projects howerver, header files would make it much more efficient and simple to reuse common code between namespaces, and help to implement interfaces for the project more fluidly.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found dealing with pointers the most difficult part of this process. The concept of them is clear to me, I just need practice with referencing vs copying as well as appropriate times to implement such concepts. I enjoy reading publications from **No Starch Press** to help ingrain and enhance the learning from the textbook, which I also found thorough and understandable for this topic. 

5. What skills from this projcet will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most transferable skill from this project to others, despite the project langauge, would be the OOP principles that were required for this project.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I attempted to implement SOLID principles to some extent, this should mean that if a problem surfaces, it will be easy to locate and fix. Additionaly, it means that the functions are easy to understand,  and are designed to fulfill only one purpose, making the architecture more human-readable.
