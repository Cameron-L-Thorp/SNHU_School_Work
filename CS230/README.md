# CS-230 Operating Platforms 
## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was a video game company who wanted to improve the experience of their users by expanding an existing game to be accessible through web browsers. In order to accomplish this goal, they required a redesigned architechture with the integration of APIs, and full-stack web develpment techniques such as singleton manipulation.
## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The documentation lays out the different options that they have, with an emphasis on the cost and maintinance of each option. This was important as it was a primary concern for their company.
## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating the design document is similar to developting a set of instructions that can be followed while actually coding. Without the design document, it is likely that elements of the architecture would have to be re-evaluated multiple times.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the UML portion, it was created prior to some of the external libraries being identified and would be more accurate and useful if it included those pieces as well.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Fully understanding the user's needs allows for easier design of the project. In this case, utilizing singleton instances was ideal because of the game session management. Without a good understanding of the user's needs, the design may turn out to be less efficient or completely ineffective.
## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
For these projects, I utilized the recommended Java tools and frameworks. In the future I would likely want to develop my own libaries to be used, and use open source APIs to ensure all areas of the architecture are accessible and malleable.
